# Snake-Tutorial

Snake game I wrote, following along with the [The Lone Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lYLYlrGLg&ab_channel=javidx9) youtube tutorial. <br />
I edited the code to look much neeter and organized it so that features can be easily added. For example, the game speeding up after food is consumed. <br />
Features:<br />
- Snake grows and speeds up as it eats food
- Scoring 
- Death and respawn
- Game Restarts
